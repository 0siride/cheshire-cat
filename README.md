"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
"I don't much care where--" said Alice.
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.

(Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Lewis Carroll)

```


## Quickstart 

You just need `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system.
Clone the repo and cd into it. Create a `.env` file containing:

```
OPENAI_KEY=<your-openai-key>
```

After that you can run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The first time (only) it will take several minutes, as the images occupy a few GBs.

- Chat with the Cheshire Cat on `localhost:3000`.
- You can also interact via REST API and try out the endpoints on `localhost:1865/docs`

When you're done, remember to CTRL+c in the terminal and
```
docker-compose down
```
