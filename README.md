"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
"I don't much care where--" said Alice.
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.

## Quickstart

You just need `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system.

Clone the repo and cd into it. Create a `.env` file containing:

```OPENAI_KEY=<your-openai-key>```

After that you can run:

```docker-compose up```

When you finish, remember to CTRL+c in the terminal and `docker-compose down`.
