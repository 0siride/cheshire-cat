## What is this?

The Cheshire Cat is a framework to build custom AIs on top of any language model.
If you ever used systems like WordPress or Django to build web apps, imagine the Cat as a similar tool, but specific for AI.

Why use the Cat:
- üåç Language model agnostic (works with OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace models, custom)
- üêò Long term memory
- üöÄ Extendible via plugins
- üîß Can use external tools (APIs, custom python code, other models)
- üìÑ Can ingest documents (.pdf, .txt, .md)
- üêã 100% [dockerized](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Active [Discord community](https://discord.gg/bHX5sNFCYU)

If you want to know more about our vision and values, read the [Code of Ethics](CODE-OF-ETHICS.md). We are committed to openness, privacy and creativity, we want to bring AI to the long tail.

This project is growing fast, refactorings and code changes happens very often, join the [Issues](https://github.com/pieroit/cheshire-cat/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to help!

## Quickstart

### Install

You just need `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system.
Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pieroit/cheshire-cat.git
```

Enter the created folder:

```bash
cd cheshire-cat
```

Create your `.env` file by copying and renaming `.env_example`:

On linux/mac
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```

After that you can run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The first time (only) it will take several minutes, as the images occupy a few GBs.

- Chat with the Cheshire Cat on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- You can also interact via REST API and try out the endpoints on [localhost:1865/docs](http://localhost:1865/docs)

As a first thing, the Cat will ask you to configure your favourite language model.
It can be done directly via the interface in the [Settings page](http://localhost:3000/settings).

Enjoy the Cat!

When you're done, remember to CTRL+c in the terminal and
```
docker-compose down
```

### Update

From time to time it is a good idea to update the Cat:

```
docker-compose down
git pull origin main
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up
```

```
"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
"I don't much care where--" said Alice.
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
