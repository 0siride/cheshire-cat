## What is this?

If you want to build a custom AI on top of a language model, the Cat can help you:

- üåç Language model agnostic (works with OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace models, custom)
- üêò Long term memory
- üîß Can use external tools (APIs, custom python code, other models)
- üñ∫ Can ingest documents (.pdf, .txt, .md)
- üöÄ Extendible via plugins
- üêã 100% [dockerized](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)



## Quickstart

You just need `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system.
Clone the repo and cd into it. Now set up your language model.

Create an empty `.env` file. Its content depends on what language model you want to use.

<details><summary>I want to use OpenAI</summary>

### OpenAI configuration

Put in your `.env` file this line:

```
OPENAI_KEY=<your-openai-key>
```
</details>

<details><summary>I want to use HuggingFace</summary>

Cheshire-Cat Loves HuggingFace!
Put in your `.env` file:

```
HF_TOKEN=<your-huggingface-token>
HF_CHECKPOINT=<selected-checkpoint>
```

example:

```
HF_TOKEN=hf_yourtoken
HF_CHECKPOINT=decapoda-research/llama-13b-hf
```

If you want to use your HuggingFace Endpoint write in your `.env` file
```
HF_TOKEN=<your-huggingface-token>
HF_ENDPOINT_URL=<your-huggingface-endpoint>
```
</details>

<details><summary>I want to use Cohere</summary>

### Cohere configuration

Put in your `.env` file this line:

```
COHERE_KEY=<your-cohere-key>
```
</details>

<br>

After that you can run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The first time (only) it will take several minutes, as the images occupy a few GBs.

- Chat with the Cheshire Cat on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- You can also interact via REST API and try out the endpoints on [localhost:1865/docs](http://localhost:1865/docs)

When you're done, remember to CTRL+c in the terminal and
```
docker-compose down
```

"Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?"
"That depends a good deal on where you want to get to," said the Cat.
"I don't much care where--" said Alice.
"Then it doesn't matter which way you go," said the Cat.
